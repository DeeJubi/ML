Key Notes Supervisor

1. Arrange first formal 1-2-1 that outlines the tasks going forward

2. Come to supervisory meetings well prepared and with a clear agenda.

3. Before the end of the first year (the first 24 months for part-time students), have the area of research defined, be acquainted with the necessary background knowledge, complete the literature review and have a provisional framework for the progress of the research, with a timetable for the rest of the research period 

4. Write regular reports, as agreed at the outset, on the progress of the research.

5. Maintain records of formal supervision meetings as agreed with supervisors and in such a way they can be accessed and understood by anyone

6. Take the initiative in raising problems or difficulties in a timely manner, however elementary or trivial they seem. Students as well as supervisors have a responsibility to initiate contact and raise questions.

7. At their initial meeting the supervisors and the student should draw up a written agreement on the role of each supervisor and arrangements for supervisory support.

8. It cannot be too strongly stressed that the success of research projects depends largely on the help and guidance offered by supervisors, especially in the early stages of the work. Close contact at that time is essential if later difficulties are to be avo

9. The frequency of supervision meetings will vary during the course of a student’s research programme especially at key times such as: during the first months of study, prior to the upgrade assessment period; and approaching thesis submission.

10. The first meeting between student and supervisors is particularly important in establishing a provisional framework for future support and getting the student’s academic work off to a good start. The following areas should be covered in the first meeting:

    • role of each supervisor;
    • frequency of future meetings;
    • timetable for early meetings;
    • arrangements for seeing and commenting on written work;
    • monitoring arrangements and timetable;
    • research facilities available;
    • University and discipline, or Affiliated Research Centre training programmes and attendance requirements;
    • general framework for the whole research project;
    • detailed plan for the early stages of the research project.

11. Students and supervisors are required by the University’s Research Degrees Committee to submit a regular report to the Associate Dean Research or Affiliated Research Centre Research Degrees Coordinator on the progress of their students

12. Students should prepare progress reports for their supervisors at regular agreed intervals.
